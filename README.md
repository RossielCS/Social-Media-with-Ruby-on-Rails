# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

> This repo includes initial code for social media app with basic styling. Its purpose is to be a starting point for Microverse students.

Here is a description of business requirements for the app:

We need to build a social media app called ‚ÄúStay in touch‚Äù.

1. As a guest user:
- I want to be able to create account/log in.
- I can see only ‚ÄúSign in‚Äù and ‚ÄúSign out‚Äù page.

2. As a logged-in user:
- I want to be able to see all users list.
- I want to be able to see selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top).
- I want to be able to send a friendship invitation.
- I want to see a button ‚ÄúInvite to friendship‚Äù next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users‚Äô list and single user page.
- I want to be able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.
- I want to be able to accept or reject friendships invitation.
- I want to be able to create new posts (text only).
- I want to be able to like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once).
- I want to be able to add comments to posts.
- I want to be able to see ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù page with posts (with number of likes and comments) written by me and all my friends (the most recent posts on the top).
- Timeline page should be the root page of the app.
